# Configure Fix Inventory

Fix Inventory needs to be configured to authenticate with your cloud providers so it can access your resources.

See [Data Sources How-To Guides](../../how-to-guides/data-sources/index.mdx) for detailed step-by-step directions on how to configure cloud providers.

:::note

**Fix Inventory requires a [set of required permissions](../../reference/iam-permissions/aws.mdx) to access AWS resources.**

We provide a CloudFormation template that creates a role with the required permissions. You can use this template to roll out the permissions to your entire organization.

See [How to Roll Out Fix Inventory AWS Permissions with CloudFormation](../../how-to-guides/configuration/roll-out-resoto-aws-permissions-with-cloudformation/index.mdx) for step-by-step directions on how to use the template.
