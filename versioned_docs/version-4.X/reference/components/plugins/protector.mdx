### Implementation details

Each Fix Inventory resource has an attributed `/metadata.protected` which takes a boolean value. By default it is set to `false`. Each Fix Inventory resource inherits BaseResource which contains two methods for cleaning up a resource, `cleanup()` and `delete()`. Both those methods will refuse to manipulate a resource once the `protected` attribute has been set to `true`. Meaning if a resource is marked as protected but has also been flagged for cleanup the cleanup will fail because protected resources cannot be deleted.
