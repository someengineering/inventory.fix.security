# `cleanup-untagged` Infrastructure App

This infrastructure app deletes cloud resources that are missing mandatory tags after a defined amount of time has passed since their creation.

## Installation

```bash
> app install cleanup-untagged
```

:::info

Upon installation, Fix Inventory will create a config `fix.apps.cleanup_untagged`.

The default minimum age threshold is 7 days. This means that if a load balancer is more than 7 days old and does not have any instances/backends attached, it will be flagged for cleanup.

The age threshold is configurable via the `min_age` config value.

:::

## Configuration

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_untagged
   ```

2. Update the configuration:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_untagged configuration"
   default:
     age: '2h'
   tags:
     - 'owner'
     - 'expiration'
    kinds:
     - 'aws_ec2_instance'
     - 'aws_ec2_volume'
     - 'aws_vpc'
     - 'aws_cloudformation_stack'
     - 'aws_elb'
     - 'aws_alb'
     - 'aws_alb_target_group'
     - 'aws_eks_cluster'
     - 'aws_eks_nodegroup'
     - 'example_instance'
     - 'example_network'
   accounts:
     aws:
       068564737731:
         name: 'playground'
         age: '7d'
       '575584959047':
         name: 'eng-sre'
     example:
       Example Account:
         name: 'Example Account'
   ```

   :::info

   Valid age units include:

   - `weeks`
   - `days`
   - `hours`
   - `minutes`

   Age units can be abbreviated to a single letter (e.g., `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc.).

   A space in between the numeric value and the unit is also optional, meaning that `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.

   :::

   :::info

   The config section consists of four sub-sections. `default`, `tags`, `classes`, and `accounts`.

   1. The `default` section specifies the default `age` a resource must have before we enforce mandatory tags on it. For instance, if `age` is set to `2h` this means that whatever mechanism creates a resource has two hours to add those mandatory tags.
   2. The `tags` section is a list of tag names that MUST exist on every resource class specified in `classes`.
   3. The `classes` section is a list of resource class names for which tags specified in the `tags` list must exist.
   4. The `accounts` section contains a dictionary with cloud IDs as keys (e.g. `aws`) and account IDs for which tags will be enforced as values (e.g. `068564737731`). Those in turn contain a `name` and optionally an `age` override.

   :::

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run cleanup-untagged
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

:::

:::note

This infrastructure app cleans up ELBs, ALBs, and ALB target groups older than the minimum age with no attached backends. Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.
