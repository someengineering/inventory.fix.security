# `cleanup-aws-alarms` Infrastructure App

This infrastructure app marks all orphaned AWS CloudWatch instance alarms (e.g., alarms associated with an EC2 instance that no longer exists) for cleanup.

## Installation

```bash
> app install cleanup-aws-alarms
```

:::info

Upon installation, Fix Inventory will create a config `fix.apps.cleanup_aws_alarms`.

:::

## Configuration

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_aws_alarms
   ```

2. Update the configuration with the desired target cloud account IDs:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_aws_alarms configuration"
   clouds_and_accounts:
     aws:
       - '1234567'
       - '567890'
   ```

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run cleanup-aws-alarms
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

:::

:::note

Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.
