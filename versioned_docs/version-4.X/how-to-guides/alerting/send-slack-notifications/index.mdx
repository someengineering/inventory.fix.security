# How to Send Slack Notifications

Fix Inventory constantly monitors your infrastructure, and can alert you to any detected issues.

One way to receive these alerts is via [Slack](https://slack.com). In this guide, we will configure Fix Inventory to send alerts to a Slack channel.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) and configured Fix Inventory to [collect your cloud resources](../../../getting-started/configure/index.mdx).

## Directions

1. [Create an Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in Slack.

2. Install the `slack` [Infrastructure App](../../infrastructure-apps/index.mdx) using the [`app install` command](../../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx):

   ```bash
   > app install slack
   ```

3. Define search criteria for which to trigger an alert. For example, let's say we have an account called `test-account` where instances with more than 4 GB of RAM are not permitted:

   ```bash
   > search is(instance) and instance_memory>4 and /ancestors.account.reported.name==test-account
   ```

4. Pipe the result of the search query to the `slack` app with your desired alert text and Slack webhook URL:

   ```bash
   > search is(instance) and instance_memory>4 and /ancestors.account.reported.name==test-account | slack --title="Large instances found in test-account" --webhook="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

   If the defined condition is currently true, you should see a new message appear in Slack:

   ![Example Slack alert](./img/example-alert.png)

   :::tip

   A default webhook URL can be defined in the `slack` app configuration so that you can simply execute `slack --title="..."`:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.slack
   ```

   :::

5. To automate the alerts, create a [job](../../../concepts/automation/index.mdx#jobs):

   ```bash
   > jobs add --id notify_large_test_instances --wait-for-event post_collect 'search is(instance) and instance_memory>4 and /ancestors.account.reported.name==test-account | slack --title="Large instances found in test-account" --webhook="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"'
   ```
