# How to Install & Run Infrastructure Apps

Fix Inventory infrastructure apps are low-code applications can be installed to extend Fix Inventory's functionality.

Infrastructure apps can perform simple tasks like [cleaning up untagged resources](../cleanup/clean-up-untagged-resources.mdx), finding abandoned load balancers, or sending notifications to [Slack](../alerting/send-slack-notifications/index.mdx), [Discord](../alerting/send-discord-notifications/index.mdx), or [PagerDuty](../alerting/create-pagerduty-alerts/index.mdx).

:::info[How safe are Fix Inventory infrastructure apps?]

An infrastructure app can not execute any Fix Inventory commands directly. Instead, it generates Fix Inventory commands which are then executed by Fix Inventory.

An app has read-only access to the Fix Inventory Infrastructure Graph using the `search()` function, meaning that it can only retrieve information about resources that are already known to Fix Inventory.

To modify resources, an app needs to generate a Fix Inventory command that does so.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) Fix Inventory.

## Directions

1.  Search for an app using the [`app search` command](../../reference/cli/app/search.mdx):

    ```bash
    > apps search cleanup
    ```

2.  Use the [`app install` command](../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx) to install the app:

    ```bash
    > apps install cleanup-untagged
    ```

3.  Run the app using the [`app run` command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx):

    ```bash
    > apps run cleanup-untagged
    ```

    :::tip

    Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

    :::

    :::info

    By default, Fix Inventory passes the app a configuration that corresponds to the app name.

    For example, when installing an app named `foobar`, Fix Inventory creates a default config named `fix.apps.foobar`.

    If you would like to run the app with an alternative config, you can specify the config name using the `--config` argument.

    Please refer to [`app run` Command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx) for more information.
