# How to Clean Up Expired Resources

A resource can be tagged with an [expiration](../../concepts/resource-management/expiration.mdx) tag that instructs Fix Inventory to clean it up after it has reached a certain age. This can serve as a safety net for when a CI job fails or the IaC tool aborts halfway through its run, or even as the primary means of managing resource lifecycles.

Fix Inventory's [`cleanup-expired` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-expired.mdx) can find and delete expired resources.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) and configured Fix Inventory to [collect your cloud resources](../../getting-started/configure/index.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to open the [Fix Inventory Worker](../../reference/components/worker.mdx) configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.worker
   ```

2. Enable cleanup by modifying the `fixworker` section of the configuration as follows:

   ```yaml
   fixworker:
     # Enable cleanup of resources
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup: true
     # Do not actually cleanup resources, just create log messages
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup_dry_run: false
     # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
     cleanup_pool_size: 16
   ```

   When cleanup is enabled, marked resources will be deleted as a part of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow), which runs each hour by default.

   :::tip

   Set `cleanup_dry_run` to `true` to simulate cleanup without actually deleting resources.

   :::

3. Use the [`app install` command](../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx) to install the `cleanup-expired` app:

   ```bash
   > app install cleanup-expired
   ```

4. Run the app using the [`app run` command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx):

   ```bash
   > app run cleanup-expired
   ```

   :::tip

   Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

   :::

   :::note

   Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.

   :::

5. [Create an event-based job](../automation/create-an-event-based-job.mdx) to run the app automatically:

   ```bash
   > jobs create --name "Clean Up Expired Resources" --wait-for-event cleanup_plan 'app run cleanup-expired'
   ```

   :::info

   The [`cleanup-expired` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-expired.mdx) will now run each time Fix Inventory emits the `cleanup_plan` [event](../../reference/events/index.mdx). The `post_cleanup_plan` event is emitted in the [`cleanup` phase](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#cleanup) of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow).

   :::

Each time the `cleanup-expired` plugin runs, expired resources will be flagged for removal during the next cleanup run.

:::info

A resource's expiration time can be defined either with an [ISO 8601](https://iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) timestamp or time delta:

| Tag Name                         | Description                                                              | Example                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `fix:expires`                    | [ISO 8601](https://iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) timestamp | `2022-09-21T10:40:11+00:00` |
| `fix:expiration` or `expiration` | Time delta from resource creation time                                   | `24h`                       |

Please see the [Resource Expiration](../../concepts/resource-management/expiration.mdx) for more information about expiration tags.

:::tip

If you would like to apply expiration tags to existing resources, [How to Find Untagged Resources](../search/find-untagged-resources.mdx) describes how to find untagged resources.

[How to Clean Up Untagged Resources](./clean-up-untagged-resources.mdx) describes how to clean up untagged resources, which can be helpful in enforcing tagging policies.
