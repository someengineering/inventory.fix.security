# How to Clean Up AWS VPC Resources

When deleting AWS VPCs, dependent network resources are sometimes left behind.

Fix Inventory's [`cleanup-aws-vpcs` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-aws-vpcs.mdx) can find and delete these orphaned resources:

- AWS VPC Peering Connections
- AWS EC2 Network ACLs
- AWS EC2 Network Interfaces
- AWS ELB
- AWS ALB
- AWS ALB Target Groups
- AWS EC2 Subnets
- AWS EC2 Security Groups
- AWS EC2 Internet Gateways
- AWS EC2 NAT Gateways
- AWS EC2 Route Tables

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) and configured Fix Inventory to [collect your AWS resources](../../how-to-guides/data-sources/collect-aws-resource-data.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to open the [Fix Inventory Worker](../../reference/components/worker.mdx) configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.worker
   ```

2. Enable cleanup by modifying the `fixworker` section of the configuration as follows:

   ```yaml
   fixworker:
     # Enable cleanup of resources
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup: true
     # Do not actually cleanup resources, just create log messages
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup_dry_run: false
     # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
     cleanup_pool_size: 16
   ```

   When cleanup is enabled, marked resources will be deleted as a part of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow), which runs each hour by default.

   :::tip

   Set `cleanup_dry_run` to `true` to simulate cleanup without actually deleting resources.

   :::

3. Use the [`app install` command](../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx) to install the `cleanup-aws-vpcs` app:

   ```bash
   > app install cleanup-aws-vpcs
   ```

   :::info

   Fix Inventory will create a default config `fix.apps.cleanup_aws_vpcs`.

   :::

4. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_aws_vpcs
   ```

5. Update the configuration to set the `min_age` property to the desired threshold for load balancer cleanup:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_aws_vpcs configuration"
   clouds_and_accounts:
     aws:
       - '1234567'
       - '567890'
   ```

6. Run the app using the [`app run` command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx):

   ```bash
   > app run cleanup-aws-vpcs
   ```

   :::tip

   Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

   :::

   :::note

   Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.

   :::

7. [Create an event-based job](../automation/create-an-event-based-job.mdx) to run the app automatically:

   ```bash
   > jobs create --name "Clean Up VPC Resources" --wait-for-event cleanup_plan 'app run cleanup-aws-vpcs'
   ```

   :::info

   The [`cleanup-aws-vpcs` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-aws-vpcs.mdx) will now run each time Fix Inventory emits the `post_cleanup_plan` [event](../../reference/events/index.mdx). The `post_cleanup_plan` event is emitted in the [`cleanup` phase](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#cleanup) of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow).

   :::

Each time the `cleanup-aws-vpcs` infrastructure app runs, network resources associated with VPCs that have been deleted or marked for [cleanup](../../concepts/resource-management/cleanup.mdx) will also be flagged for removal during the next cleanup run.
