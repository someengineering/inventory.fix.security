# Telemetry

Fix Inventory collects anonymized telemetry data to inform product development. Telemetry data helps pinpoint roadblocks or issues, and also helps to identify how we can help users get more value out of Fix Inventory.

All data collected is anonymousâ€”**we do not capture or store any personally identifiable information (PII)**. There are no unique identifiers that allow us to correlate a Fix Inventory installation back to an actual person.

## Types of Telemetry Data \{#types}

There are currently two types of telemetry data collected.

### Usage Data

Collected usage data includes non-sensitive information on how and what Fix Inventory features are used. This data helps us to measure product adoption and understand how Fix Inventory is used, and informs development of new features. This data does not contain any sensitive or personally identifiable data.

The following are examples of metrics we currently monitor based on this usage data:

- Number of started [`fixcore`](./components/core.mdx) instances
- Number of long-running [`fixcore`](./components/core.mdx) instances (greater than one hour)
- Number of executed [CLI commands](./cli/index.mdx)
- Number of executed [jobs](../concepts/automation/index.mdx)
- Number and type of [configured cloud providers](../getting-started/configure/index.mdx) as well as with configuration change events
- [Installation method](../getting-started/install/index.mdx)

### Error Reporting

Error reporting aids us in identifying and fixing bugs or issues in Fix Inventory. This reporting does not contain any sensitive or personally identifiable data.

## Disabling Telemetry Reporting \{#disabling}

Telemetry can be disabled via the `fixcore.runtime.usage_metrics` [Fix Inventory Core configuration](./configuration/core.mdx) option.
