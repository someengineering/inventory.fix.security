# `cleanup-expired` Infrastructure App

This infrastructure app looks for resources with the tags `expiration` or `fix:expires` and flags them for cleanup if they are expired.

:::info

A resource's expiration time can be defined either with an [ISO 8601](https://iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) timestamp or time delta:

| Tag Name                         | Description                                                              | Example                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `fix:expires`                    | [ISO 8601](https://iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) timestamp | `2022-09-21T10:40:11+00:00` |
| `fix:expiration` or `expiration` | Time delta from resource creation time                                   | `24h`                       |

Please see the [Resource Expiration](../../concepts/resource-management/expiration.mdx) for more information about expiration tags.

:::

## Installation

```bash
> app install cleanup-expired
```

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run cleanup-expired
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

:::

:::note

Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.
