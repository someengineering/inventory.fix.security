# `cleanup-volumes` Infrastructure App

This infrastructure app cleans up unused storage volumes.

## Installation

```bash
> app install cleanup-volumes
```

:::info

Upon installation, Fix Inventory will create a config `fix.apps.cleanup_volumes`.

**The default minimum age threshold is 14 days.** This means that if a storage volume is not in use and has not had any read or write IOPS within the last 14 days, it will be flagged for cleanup.

The age threshold is configurable via the `min_age` config value.

:::

## Configuration

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_volumes
   ```

2. Update the configuration with the desired minimum age:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_volumes configuration"
   min_age: 14d
   ```

   :::info

   Valid age units include:

   - `weeks`
   - `days`
   - `hours`
   - `minutes`

   Age units can be abbreviated to a single letter (e.g., `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc.).

   A space in between the numeric value and the unit is also optional, meaning that `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.

   :::

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run cleanup-volumes
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

:::

:::note

This infrastructure app cleans up unused storage volumes with no read or write IOPS during the defined timeframe. Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.
