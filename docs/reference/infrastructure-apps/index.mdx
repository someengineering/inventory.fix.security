# Infrastructure Apps

Fix Inventory infrastructure apps are low-code applications can be installed to extend Fix Inventory's functionality.

Infrastructure apps can perform simple tasks like [cleaning up untagged resources](../../how-to-guides/cleanup/clean-up-untagged-resources.mdx), finding abandoned load balancers, or sending notifications to [Slack](../../how-to-guides/alerting/send-slack-notifications/index.mdx), [Discord](../../how-to-guides/alerting/send-discord-notifications/index.mdx), or [PagerDuty](../../how-to-guides/alerting/create-pagerduty-alerts/index.mdx).

:::info[How safe are Fix Inventory infrastructure apps?]

An infrastructure app can not execute any Fix Inventory commands directly. Instead, it generates Fix Inventory commands which are then executed by Fix Inventory.

An app has read-only access to the Fix Inventory Infrastructure Graph using the `search()` function, meaning that it can only retrieve information about resources that are already known to Fix Inventory.

To modify resources, an app needs to generate a Fix Inventory command that does so.
