# `cleanup-aws-loadbalancers` Infrastructure App

This infrastructure app cleans up AWS ALB/ELB load balancers with no instances attached to them.

## Installation

```bash
> app install cleanup-aws-loadbalancers
```

:::info

Upon installation, Fix Inventory will create a config `fix.apps.cleanup_aws_loadbalancers`.

**The default minimum age threshold is 7 days.** This means that if a load balancer is more than 7 days old and does not have any instances/backends attached, it will be flagged for cleanup.

The age threshold is configurable via the `min_age` config value.

:::

## Configuration

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_aws_loadbalancers
   ```

2. Update the configuration with the desired minimum age:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_aws_loadbalancers configuration"
   min_age: '7 days'
   ```

   :::info

   Valid age units include:

   - `weeks`
   - `days`
   - `hours`
   - `minutes`

   Age units can be abbreviated to a single letter (e.g., `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc.).

   A space in between the numeric value and the unit is also optional, meaning that `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.

   :::

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run cleanup-aws-loadbalancers
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

:::

:::note

This infrastructure app cleans up ELBs, ALBs, and ALB target groups older than the minimum age with no attached backends. Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.
