# `tagvalidator` Infrastructure App

This plugin validates the contents of expiration tags. With it you can enforce a max. expiration length for certain resources in an account. For instance you could have an org policy that says in our "dev" account compute instances are only allowed to exist for 2 days max. Then this plugin can ensure that the expiration tag on those instances is set to no more than 2 days. If it is set to e.g. 50h it would be corrected down to 48h.

## Installation

```bash
> app install tagvalidator
```

:::info

Upon installation, Fix Inventory will create a config `fix.apps.tagvalidator`.

:::

## Configuration

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.tagvalidator
   ```

2. Update the configuration:

   ```yaml title="tagvalidator configuration"
   config:
     default:
       expiration: '24h'
     kinds:
       - 'aws_ec2_instance'
       - 'aws_vpc'
       - 'aws_cloudformation_stack'
       - 'aws_elb'
       - 'aws_alb'
       - 'aws_alb_target_group'
       - 'aws_eks_cluster'
       - 'aws_eks_nodegroup'
       - 'aws_ec2_nat_gateway'
     accounts:
       aws:
         '123465706934':
           name: 'eng-audit'
         '123479172032':
           name: 'eng-devprod'
         '123453451782':
           name: 'sales-lead-gen'
           expiration: '12h'
         '123415487488':
           name: 'sales-hosted-lead-gen'
           expiration: '8d'
   ```

   :::info

   The configuration contains a `default` section with the expiration that should be used for all accounts by default.

   The `kinds` section contains the list of kinds that these expiration tag rules apply to.

   The `accounts` section contain the cloud ids followed by the account ids. Each account ID must contain a name and optionally an expiration that overwrites the global default.

   :::

## Usage

Run the app using the [`app run` command](../cli/app/run.mdx):

```bash
> app run tagvalidator
```

:::tip

Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.
