# Fix Inventory Shell

The `fixsh` command starts [Fix Inventory Shell (`fixshell`)](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory/tree/main/fixshell), which is used to interact with [`fixcore`](./core.mdx).

Fix Inventory Shell allows you to explore the graph, find resources of interest, mark them for cleanup, fix their tagging, aggregate over their metadata to create metrics, and format the output for use in a third-party script or system.

:::info

See [Launch Fix Inventory](../../getting-started/launch/index.mdx) for instructions on how to start Fix Inventory Shell.

Please refer to [Command-Line Interface](../cli/index.mdx) for details on how to use Fix Inventory Shell.

### Environment Variables

CLI options can also be set via environment variables. The environment variable name is the same as the option name, but in uppercase with the prefix `fixshell_` and dashes replaced by underscores.

For example, `--fixcore-uri https://foobar.tld:8900` would become `fixshell_RESOTOCORE_URI=https://foobar.tld:8900`.
