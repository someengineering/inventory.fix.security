# Configuration

## Internal Configuration

Fix Inventory uses an internal configuration system for its [components](../components/index.mdx). Configuration is maintained within [Fix Inventory Core](../components/core.mdx) and can be edited using [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) using the [`config edit` command](../cli/config/edit.mdx).

### Listing Configurations

```bash title="Start the Fix Inventory Shell"
$ fixsh --psk changeme --fixcore-uri https://fixcore.fixinventory.svc.cluster.local:8900
```

:::note

Be sure to adjust the above PSK and Fix Inventory Core URI arguments to reflect your setup!

:::

```bash title="List available configurations"
> configs list
```

Fix Inventory automatically creates the following configurations by default:

- `fixinventory.core`
- `fixinventory.core.commands`
- `fixinventory.worker`
- `fixinventory.metrics`

### Editing Configuration

```bash title="Edit the Fix Inventory Worker configuration"
> config edit fixinventory.worker
```

Upon execution of the above command, [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) presents the specified configuration in [YAML format](https://yaml.org) using the local text editor as defined by the [`EDITOR` environment variable](#text-editor).

```yaml title="Example Fix Inventory Worker configuration"
fixworker:
  # Enable cleanup of resources
  cleanup: false
  # Do not actually cleanup resources, just create log messages
  cleanup_dry_run: true
  # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
  cleanup_pool_size: 16
  # List of collectors to run
  collector:
    - aws
    - gcp
    - k8s
  # Dump the generated JSON data to disk
  debug_dump_json: false
  # Use forked process instead of threads
  fork_process: true
  # Name of the graph to import data into and run searches on
  graph: resoto
  # Resource kind to merge graph at (cloud or account)
  graph_merge_kind: cloud
  # Collector thread/process pool size
  pool_size: 5
  # Directory to create temporary files in
  tempdir: null
  # Collection/cleanup timeout in seconds
  timeout: 10800
  # IP address to bind the web server to
  web_host: '::'
  # Web root in browser (change if running behind an ingress proxy)
  web_path: /
  # Web server tcp port to listen on
  web_port: 9956
  ...
...
```

:::note

While the configuration is presented in [YAML format](https://yaml.org) for easy editing, all configuration is stored within Fix Inventory's database in a data structure following a strictly typed model.

This means that you will get an error if, for instance, you attempt to set the value of `fixworker.pool_size` to `foobar`, because `pool_size` is of type `int`.

### Setting Individual Properties

Instead of editing a component's configuration in a text editor, it is also possible to set the values of specific properties using the [`config set` command](../cli/config/set.mdx).

```title="Modify a specific property of the Fix Inventory Worker configuration"
> config set fixinventory.worker fixworker.pool_size=5
```

### Overriding Individual Properties

Fix Inventory also has support for overriding configuration. Overrides allow for values like passwords, credentials, and API keys to be retrieved from a secure credential store and passed into the environment, rather than being stored as plain text inside Fix Inventory's database.

There are two ways to overriding configuration properties:

1. `--override` flag

   ```bash
   $ fixworker --override fixworker.pool_size=5 fixworker.cleanup_pool_size=20
   ```

2. `<COMPONENT_NAME>_OVERRIDE` environment variable

   ```bash
   $ export FIXWORKER_OVERRIDE=fixworker.pool_size=5
   $ fixworker
   ```

It is possible to override multiple values by delimiting them with a space:

```bash
$ export FIXWORKER_OVERRIDE="fixworker.pool_size=5 fixworker.cleanup_pool_size=20"
$ fixworker
```

Alternatively, if a value contains a space, it is also possible to use separate, enumerated environment variables:

```bash
$ export FIXWORKER_OVERRIDE0=fixworker.pool_size=5
$ export FIXWORKER_OVERRIDE1=fixworker.cleanup_pool_size=20
$ fixworker
```

#### Overriding List Properties

If the property type is a list/an array, it is possible to specifying multiple values as a comma-separated list of values:

```bash
  $ fixcore --override fixcore.api.web_hosts=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.1
```

or

```bash
  $ export FIXCORE_OVERRIDE=fixcore.api.web_hosts=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.1
```

### Restoring Defaults

Default configurations can be restored simply by deleting the configuration and restarting the component.

```bash title="Delete the Fix Inventory Worker configuration"
> config delete fixinventory.worker
```

```bash title="Restart Fix Inventory Worker"
$ fixworker
```

## Environment Variables

### Text Editor

The text editor opened by [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx) can be configured via the `EDITOR` environment variable.

When running Fix Inventory in Docker, the default text editor is [nano](https://nano-editor.org).

```bash
$ export EDITOR=nano
```

### Logging Format

Fix Inventory components produce logs in [<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>](https://json.org) format by default, with the exception of [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx).

The rationale behind this behavior is that [Core](../components/core.mdx), [Worker](../components/worker.mdx), and [Metrics](../components/metrics.mdx) are likely running on something like a Kubernetes cluster in a data center, with logs ingested by a central logging system. [Fix Inventory Shell](../components/shell.mdx), on the other hand, is executed on a user's local machine so the log output is formatted for readability.

<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-format logging can be disabled via the `FIX_LOG_TEXT` environment variable:

```bash
$ export FIX_LOG_TEXT=true
```
