# Fix Inventory Worker Configuration

## Configuration Files

You may need make your AWS `credentials` file, Google Cloud service account JSON files, Kubernetes kubeconfig files, etc. available to Fix Inventory Worker so that it can collect your resources.

### Mounting Configuration Files

You can mount configuration files within the `fixworker` container instead of defining them in the configuration.

1.  Add the desired volume definition to the `fixworker` service in `docker-compose.yaml`:

    ```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
    services:
      ...
      fixworker:
        image: somecr.io/someengineering/fixinventoryworker:{{imageTag}}
        container_name: fixworker
        ...
    # highlight-start
        volumes:
          - $HOME/.aws:/home/fixinventory/.aws
    # highlight-end
      ...
    ...
    ```

2.  Recreate the `fixworker` container with the updated service definition:

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

    :::note

    [Docker Compose V2 integrated compose functions in to the Docker platform.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command)

    In Docker Compose V2, the command is `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.

## Multi-Core Machines

Fix Inventory resource collection speed depends heavily on the number of CPU cores available to the worker. When collecting hundreds of accounts, [Fix Inventory Worker](../components/worker.mdx) can easily saturate 64 cores or more.

The amount of RAM required depends on the number of resources in each account. As a rule of thumb, estimate 512 MB of RAM and 0.5 CPU cores per account concurrently collected, with a minimum of 4 cores and 16 GB for a production setup.

The following settings specify how many [Worker](../components/worker.mdx) threads Fix Inventory starts:

```yaml
fixworker:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
  cleanup_pool_size: 16
  # Collector thread/process pool size
  pool_size: 5
# highlight-end
aws:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # Account thread/process pool size
  account_pool_size: 32
  # Region thread pool size
  region_pool_size: 20
# highlight-end
gcp:
  ...
# highlight-start
  # GCP project thread/process pool size
  project_pool_size: 32
# highlight-end
...
```

- The `fixworker.pool_size` setting determines how many collectors (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Kubernetes, etc.) are run concurrently.

- `aws.account_pool_size` and `gcp.project_pool_size` are used to determine how many accounts or projects respectively are collected concurrently.

- Within AWS, `aws.region_pool_size` is used to determine how many regions per account are collected concurrently.

:::warning

At peak, Fix Inventory creates concurrent network connections for each region in every account. With a single cloud with 32 accounts and 20 regions per account, for example, there will be a maximum of 32 Ã— 20 = 640 connections.

This is not a problem in a data center or with a <abbr title="small office / home office">SOHO</abbr> router, where hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of new connections per second are supported. However, if you are testing Fix Inventory at home using a consumer-grade router, you should be conservative when configuring thread pool sizes.
