# Install Fix Inventory

[Docker](https://docker.com) images allow Fix Inventory to be run in a loosely isolated environment called a [container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview#containers).

:::tip

Don't want to manage your own Fix Inventory installation? Get started for free with **[Fix](https://fix.security)**, an all-in-one security dashboard built on top of Fix Inventory.

:::

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started#download-and-install-docker)

- [Docker Compose >= 1.29](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

- At least 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM

  :::note

  Fix Inventory performs CPU-intensive graph operations. In a production setup, we recommend at least four cores and 16 gigabytes of RAM. See [Configuring Fix Inventory Worker](../../reference/configuration/worker.mdx#multi-core-machines) for more information.

## Directions

1. Fetch the required files from the [`someengineering/fixinventory` GitHub repository](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory):

   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p fixinventory/dockerV2
   $ cd fixinventory
   $ curl -Lo docker-compose.yaml {{dockerComposeUrl}}
   $ curl -Lo dockerV2/prometheus.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/someengineering/fixinventory/{{repoBranch}}/dockerV2/prometheus.yml
   ```

   :::note

   By default, the `fixshell` service bind-mounts the `~/fixinventory-downloads` directory to `/home/fixinventory/downloads` in the container. This allows you to access files outputted by Fix Inventory Shell on the host.

   If you would like to change the download location from `~/fixinventory-downloads` to another directory, you can do so by editing the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   fixshell:
     ...
     volumes:
   # highlight-next-line
       - ~/fixinventory-downloads:/home/fixinventory/downloads
     ...
   ```

   :::

2. Start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose pull
   $ docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Upon execution of `docker-compose up -d`, Docker Compose will start all components and set up the system. This process takes approximately 1-3 minutes, depending on your machine and internet connection.

   :::note

   [Docker Compose V2 integrated compose functions in to the Docker platform.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command)

   In Docker Compose V2, the command is `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.
