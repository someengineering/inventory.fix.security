# How to Clean Up Untagged Resources

Resource tags are an essential tool in finding and tracking an organization's cloud resources, but tags are only useful if applied consistently.

Fix Inventory's [`cleanup-untagged` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-untagged.mdx) can enforce tagging policies by automatically cleaning up resources that do not have required tags (e.g., `owner` and `expiration`).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) and configured Fix Inventory to [collect your cloud resources](../../getting-started/configure/index.mdx).

## Directions

1. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to open the [Fix Inventory Worker](../../reference/components/worker.mdx) configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.worker
   ```

2. Enable cleanup by modifying the `fixworker` section of the configuration as follows:

   ```yaml
   fixworker:
     # Enable cleanup of resources
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup: true
     # Do not actually cleanup resources, just create log messages
   # highlight-next-line
     cleanup_dry_run: false
     # How many cleanup threads to run in parallel
     cleanup_pool_size: 16
   ```

   When cleanup is enabled, marked resources will be deleted as a part of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow), which runs each hour by default.

   :::tip

   Set `cleanup_dry_run` to `true` to simulate cleanup without actually deleting resources.

   :::

3. Use the [`app install` command](../../reference/cli/app/install.mdx) to install the `cleanup-untagged` app:

   ```bash
   > app install cleanup-untagged
   ```

   :::info

   Fix Inventory will create a default config `fix.apps.cleanup_untagged`.

   :::

4. Execute the following command in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to open the infrastructure app configuration for editing:

   ```bash
   > config edit fix.apps.cleanup_untagged
   ```

5. Update the configuration:

   ```yaml title="cleanup_untagged configuration"
   default:
     age: '2h'
   tags:
     - 'owner'
     - 'expiration'
    kinds:
     - 'aws_ec2_instance'
     - 'aws_ec2_volume'
     - 'aws_vpc'
     - 'aws_cloudformation_stack'
     - 'aws_elb'
     - 'aws_alb'
     - 'aws_alb_target_group'
     - 'aws_eks_cluster'
     - 'aws_eks_nodegroup'
     - 'example_instance'
     - 'example_network'
   accounts:
     aws:
       068564737731:
         name: 'playground'
         age: '7d'
       '575584959047':
         name: 'eng-sre'
     example:
       Example Account:
         name: 'Example Account'
   ```

   :::info

   Valid age units include:

   - `weeks`
   - `days`
   - `hours`
   - `minutes`

   Age units can be abbreviated to a single letter (e.g., `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc.).

   A space in between the numeric value and the unit is also optional, meaning that `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.

   :::

   :::info

   The config section consists of four sub-sections. `default`, `tags`, `classes`, and `accounts`.

   1. The `default` section specifies the default `age` a resource must have before we enforce mandatory tags on it. For instance, if `age` is set to `2h` this means that whatever mechanism creates a resource has two hours to add those mandatory tags.
   2. The `tags` section is a list of tag names that MUST exist on every resource class specified in `classes`.
   3. The `classes` section is a list of resource class names for which tags specified in the `tags` list must exist.
   4. The `accounts` section contains a dictionary with cloud IDs as keys (e.g. `aws`) and account IDs for which tags will be enforced as values (e.g. `068564737731`). Those in turn contain a `name` and optionally an `age` override.

   :::

6. Run the app using the [`app run` command](../../reference/cli/app/run.mdx):

   ```bash
   > app run cleanup-untagged
   ```

   :::tip

   Add the optional `--dry-run` flag to see what commands the app would perform, without actually executing them.

   :::

   :::note

   Items tagged with `expiration: never` will not be flagged for cleanup.

   :::

7. [Create an event-based job](../automation/create-an-event-based-job.mdx) to run the app automatically:

   ```bash
   > jobs create --name "Clean Up Untagged Resources" --wait-for-event cleanup_plan 'app run cleanup-untagged'
   ```

   :::info

   The [`cleanup-untagged` infrastructure app](../../reference/infrastructure-apps/cleanup-untagged.mdx) will now run each time Fix Inventory emits the `cleanup_plan` [event](../../reference/events/index.mdx). The `post_cleanup_plan` event is emitted in the [`cleanup` phase](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#cleanup) of the [`collect_and_cleanup` workflow](../../reference/workflows/index.mdx#collect_and_cleanup-workflow).

   :::

Each time the `cleanup_untagged` plugin runs, resources for which the specified tag requirements are not met will be flagged for removal during the next cleanup run.
