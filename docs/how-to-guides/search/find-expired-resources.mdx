# How to Find Expired Resources

A resource can be tagged with an [expiration](../../concepts/resource-management/expiration.mdx) tag that instructs Fix Inventory to clean it up at a defined time. This can serve as a safety net for when a CI job fails or the IaC tool aborts halfway through its run, or even as the primary means of managing resource lifecycles.

Fix Inventory calculates the expiration time of a resource based on its expiration tag and stores the result as the value of the `metadata.expires` property.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already [installed](../../getting-started/install/index.mdx) and configured Fix Inventory to [collect your cloud resources](../../getting-started/configure/index.mdx).

## Directions

Execute the following search in [Fix Inventory Shell](../../reference/components/shell.mdx) to list all expired resources:

```bash
> search /metadata.expires < "@utc@"
```

:::note

This search finds all resources that have an `expires` property that is less than the current time. Fix Inventory automatically expands `@utc@` to the current date and time. See `help placeholders` for more information on placeholder strings.
