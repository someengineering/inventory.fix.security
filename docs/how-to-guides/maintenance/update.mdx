# How to Update Fix Inventory

We regularly release [new versions of Fix Inventory](/releases) with bug fixes and new features, and recommend keeping your Fix Inventory installation up to date.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started#download-and-install-docker)

- [Docker Compose >= 1.29](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Directions

1.  Fetch the `docker-compose.yaml` file for the latest Fix Inventory version. See the [list of versions](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory/releases) if you want to use a specific version.

    ```bash
    $ curl -Lo docker-compose.yaml {{dockerComposeUrl}}
    ```

2.  Restart the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

    :::note

    [Docker Compose V2 integrated compose functions in to the Docker platform.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command)

    In Docker Compose V2, the command is `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.
